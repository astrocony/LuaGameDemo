# Lua Game – Portfolio Demo 🎮

This is a simplified demo of my pixel art web game, developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

🧠 What I did:
- Designed all assets in Procreate (sprites, backgrounds)
- Coded character movement and interaction
- Created UI and structure of a login system (still in progress)

💡 Future plans:
- Add user accounts with Firebase
- Save player progress
- Unlockable content and quests
